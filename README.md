# Bear Alfred Workflow

Forked from [chrisbro/alfred-bear](https://github.com/chrisbro/alfred-bear)

[Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) to search and create notes in [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/). View it on [Packal](http://www.packal.org/workflow/bear), or [join in the discussion on the Alfred forums](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/10403-bear-workflow-search-and-create-notes/).

## Install
To install, download a [released alfred-bear workflow](https://github.com/chrisbro/alfred-bear/releases/download/0.3.5/alfred-bear.alfredworkflow) and double-click to open in Alfred. Easy-peasy.

## Searching and opening results 
`bs` -- Search for a note by title/content and open it in Bear.

`bst` -- Search for a tag (a group of notes) by tag title and open it in Bear.

## Creating a new note
`bn I love notes!` -- Creates a new note with the title and text "*I love notes!*"

`bn I love notes! #love #notes` -- Creates a new note with the title and text "*I love notes!*" and the tags "*#love*" and "*#notes*"

## Known Issues
- Creating tags only works with single-word tags - multiword tags hopefully to come.

## Todo
- Append text to existing notes.
- Figure out multi-word tags.
